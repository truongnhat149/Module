                    <p>  <span class="micro-title">Introduction</span> Pikachu (Japanese: ピカチュウ Hepburn: Pikachū) (/ˈpiːkətʃuː/; [pikatɕɯː]) are a
                            species of Pokémon, fictional creatures that appear in an assortment of video games,
                            animated television shows and movies, trading card games, and comic books
                            licensed by The Pokémon Company, a Japanese corporation.</p>
                    <p>
                            The Pikachu design was conceived by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken
                            Sugimori. Pikachu first appeared in Pokémon Red and Green in Japan, and later in
                            the first internationally released Pokémon video games, Pokémon Red and Blue, for
                            the original Game Boy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Like other species of Pokémon, Pikachu are often captured and groomed by humans
                            to fight other Pokémon for sport. Pikachu are one of the most well-known varieties
                            of Pokémon, largely because Pikachu is a central character in the Pokémon anime
                            series. Pikachu is regarded as a major character of the Pokémon franchise as well as
                            its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years. It is also
                            seen as one of the major mascots forN intendo.

                    <p> <span class="micro-title">Concept and Design</span>
                            Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Pokémon series began in Japan in 1996, and features several species of
                            creatures called "Pokémon" that players, called "trainers", are encouraged to capture, train, and use to battle other players' Pokémon
                            or interact with the game's world.[1][2] Pikachu was one of several different Pokémon designs conceived by Game Freak's character
                            development team. Artist Atsuko Nishida is credited as the main person behind Pikachu's design,[3][4] which was later finalized by
                            artist Ken Sugimori.[5][6] According to series producer Satoshi Tajiri, the idea of the name came from a mouse like animal called pika
                            and then derived from a combination of two Japanese sounds: pika, a sound an electric spark makes, and chu, a sound a mouse
                            makes.[7] Despite its name's origins, however, Nishida based Pikachu's generation 1 design, especially its cheeks, off of squirrels. [8]
                            Developer Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu's name as one of the most difficult to create, due to an effort to make it appealing to both
                            Japanese and American audiences.[9]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Standing 1 ft 4 in (0.4m) tall, Pikachu were the first "Electric-type" Pokémon created, their design intended to revolve around the
                            concept of electricity.[10] They appear as Pika-like creatures that have short, yellow fur with brown markings covering their backs
                            and parts of their lightning bolt shaped tails. They have black-tipped, pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks, which
                            can spark with electricity.[11] In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, gender differences were introduced; a female Pikachu now has an
                            indent at the end of its tail, giving it a heart-shaped appearance. They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at
                            their targets. Within the context of the franchise, a Pikachu can transform, or "evolve" into a Raichu when exposed to a
                            "Thunderstone". In later titles an evolutionary predecessor was introduced named "Pichu", which evolves into a Pikachu after
                            establishing a close friendship with its trainer.

                            In the video games, Pikachu is a low-level Pokémon, which has appeared in all of the games except Black and White naturally
                            without having to trade.[16] The game Pokémon Yellow features a Pikachu as the only available Starter Pokémon. Based on the
                            Pikachu from the Pokémon anime, it refuses to stay in its Poké Ball, and instead follows the main character around on screen. The
                            trainer can speak to it and it displays different reactions depending on how it is treated.[17] Pokémon Yellow followed the anime series
                            closely, with Pikachu as a central character.[18]
                            An event from April 1 to May 5, 2010 allowed players of Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver to access a route on the Pokéwalker
                            which solely contained Pikachu which knew attacks that they were not normally compatible with, Surf and Fly.[19] Both of these
                            attacks can be used outside battles as travel aids.

                            The Pokémon anime series and films feature the adventures of Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu, traveling through the various regions
                            of the Pokémon universe. They are accompanied by a group of alternating friends, includinMg isty, Brock, Tracey, May, Max, Dawn,
                            Iris, Cilan, Bonnie, Serena, and Clemont.

                            Pikachu is one of the main Pokémon used in many of the Pokémon manga series. In Pokémon Adventures, main characters Red and
                            Yellow both train Pikachu, which create an egg thatG old hatches into a Pichu. Other series, including Magical Pokémon Journey and
                            Getto Da Ze also feature Pikachu while other manga series, such as Electric Tale of Pikachu,[32] and Ash & Pikachu, feature the most
                            well known Pikachu belonging to Ketchum in the anime series[3.2]

                            In the first episode, Ash Ketchum, a young boy from Pallet Town, turns 10 years old and is ready to acquire his first Pokémon.
                            Hopeful to become a Pokémon Master, the night before he receives his starter Pokémon (either Squirtle, Charmander or Bulbasaur)
                            he has a dream where he is catching a Pokémon and actually, while sleeping, physically breaks his alarm clock. Ash quickly runs to
                            Professor Oak's lab, where he finds out all the starter Pokémon have been given away. Professor Oak tells Ash there is one more
                            Pokémon, a male Pikachu. At first, Pikachu lagrely ignores Ash's requests, shocking him frequently and refusing to be confined to the
                            conventional method of Pokémon transportation, aP oké Ball. However, Ash puts himself in danger to defend Pikachu from a flock of
                            wild Spearow,[28] then rushes the electric mouse to a Pokémon Center. Through these demonstrations of respect and unconditional
                            commitment to Pokémon, Pikachu warms up to Ash, and their friendship is formed. Howev,e hre still refuses to go into his Poké Ball.
                            Soon after, Pikachu shows great power that sets him apart from Pokémon, and other Pikachu, which causes Team Rocket to
                            constantly attempt to capture him in order to win favor from their boss, Giovanni.[29] Only once had Ash almost released Pikachu,
                            and that was in the episode "Pikachu's Goodbye", because Ash thought Pikachu would be happier living in a colony of wild Pikachu,
                            but Pikachu chose him instead.[30] Pikachu also has his very own segment in the first two seasons called "Pikachu's Jukebox", which
                            included songs from 2.B.A. Master.

                            As the mascot of the franchise, Pikachu has made multiple appearances in various
                            promotional events and merchandise. In 1998, then Topeka, Kansas Mayor Joan
                            Wagnon renamed the town "Topikachu" for a day,[37] and a "got milk?"
                            advertisement featured Pikachu on April 25, 2000.[38] A Pikachu balloon has been
                            featured in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade since 2001.[39] The original
                            balloon was flown for the last time publicly at the Pokémon: Tenth Anniversary
                            "Party of the Decade" on August 8, 2006 in Bryant Park in New York
                            City,[40][41][42][43] and a new Pikachu balloon that chases a Poké Ball and has lightup
                            cheeks debuted at the 2006 parade[.44] In the 2014 parade, a new Pikachu balloon
                            was wearing a green scarf and holding a smaller Pikachu snowman[4.5]

                            Pikachu has appeared several of times on The Simpsons. In the 2002 episode "Bart
                            vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade", Bart Simpson has a hallucination while taking a test in
                            class and envisages his classmates as various television characters, one of which is
                            Pikachu.[50] Maggie Simpson appeared as a Pikachu in a couch gag during the
                            opening sequence of the 2003 episode "'Tis the Fifteenth Season".[51] The couch gag
                            was used a second time for the 2004 episode "Fraudcast News".[52] In the 2010
                            episode "Postcards from the Wedge", Bart is distracted from his homework by an
                            episode of Pokémon. After watching Ash Ketchum talk to his Pikachu, he muses
                            how the show has managed to stay fresh over the years[5. 3]

                            During the first episode of the 11th season of Top Gear, presenter Richard
                            Hammond compared an image of the Tata Nano to one of Pikachu, stating, "they've
                            saved money on the styling 'cause they've just based it on this."[46] In the episode "Dual" of the third season of Heroes, Hiro
                            Nakamura is nicknamed "Pikachu" by Daphne Millbrook, much to his chagrin. He is called this again by Tracy Strauss, after which
